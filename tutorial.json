      "content": "I have started you off with a `periodic_table` database that has information about some chemical elements. You can connect to it by entering `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=periodic_table` in the terminal. It’s a good idea to get a little familiar with the existing tables, columns, and rows. Read the instructions below and complete user stories to finish the project. Certain tests may not pass until other user stories are complete. Good luck!\n\nPart 1: Fix the database\n\nI made some mistakes when creating the database, there are a few things I need fixed or changed. See the user stories below for what to change.\n\nPart 2: Create your git repository\n\nI need you to make a small bash program for me. I want the code version controlled with `git`, so you will need to turn the suggested folder into a git repository.\n\nPart 3: Create the script\n\nLastly, I want to you to make a script that accepts an argument that can be an `atomic number`, `symbol`, or `name` of an element and outputs some information about the given element.",

            "Your `melting_point_celsius` and `boiling_point_celsius` columns should not accept null values",
            "You should add the `UNIQUE` constraint to the `symbol` and `name` columns from the `elements` table",
            "Your `symbol` and `name` columns should have the `NOT NULL` constraint",
            "You should set the `atomic_number` column from the `properties` table as a foreign key that references the column of the same name in the `elements` table",
            "You should create a `types` table that will store the three types of elements",
            "Your `types` table should have a `type_id` column that is an integer and the primary key",
            "Your `types` table should have a `type` column that's a `VARCHAR` and cannot be `null`. It will store the different types from the `type` column in the `properties` table",
